## Tech and Features Used


| Feature       | Summary                                                                                                  | 
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Materialize CSS Framework | Used Materialize to style and index.html and make it responsive.                              |
| Javascript    | Used Javascript to update main index.html with resort weather information, recent tweets and a google map. |
| JQuery        | Used JQuery to simplify working with DOM and perform ajax API calls.                             |
| Weather Unlocked API | Robust third party weather API that includes snow reports and forecasts for resorts. The subscription tier used meant that we needed to control what resorts users can search. This was done with a drop down that is tied to an array of searchable resorts. |
|Twitter Open API| Twitter open API allowed us to embed tweets from any twitter handle. We tied this to the array of resorts we created to allow us to display tweets from any resort in the future provided they have a twitter handle.|
|Google Maps API| Google maps API allowed us to embed a map that centers around and marks a designated location. This is also controlled by our resorts array. |
